            Our Story
        </h2>
        <p>
            Arno Vanmassenhove was 25 years old when he became financially free, but it wasn't an easy road
            to get there. He used to be the biggest school loser and his parents divorced when he was a 
            teenager. After the divorce he decided to live alone with a roommate, but eventually, his roommate 
            left him and Arno lost his job.
            <br><br>
            He faced rejection at every interview, with employers telling him that he would never make €1800/month without
            studying for 7 years. Although he knew this wasn't true, he still became a weed and game addict.
            He even atempted suicide, but was fortunately stopped in time.
            <br><br>
            After this, Arno moved to Spain and was lied to by a business partner. After this, the pandemic
            began which led to the failure of his video production company. But Arno didn't give up and started
            the Freedom Academy. Through the power of mindset and business, Arno paved his way to ultimate success.
            <br><br>
            Through practicing what he preaches, this education was the most valuable path ever. It
            wasn't easy, it was painful but the lessons were absolute gold and the reason of the big impact of
            the company and the customer results.
            <br><br>
            The rest was history, as Arno helped over 100 people and changed and saved many lives.
            Today, he's financially free but he's also humble and genuinely happy.
            <br><br>
            He creates close relationships with entrepreneurs within his mastermind, where he helps to
            start and scale their businesses, and his success story has inspired countless people across the world.
            All of this happened in just 4 years of persistence, ups and downs, but always moving forward.
